Lately, I've been watching a lot of [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtinbF-Q-fVthA0qrFQTgXQ), one of YouTube's best and most famous filmmakers. He's primarily known for inspirational  and adventurous videos, plus his near-daily vlog that has hundreds of episodes. His videos get millions of views, and for good reason. It's not just because they're entertaining and high quality (they are), but also because Neistat's _personality_ is irresistible. His vlogs showcase his life and personality better than anyone else I've followed. Neistat also uses cinematic techniques to make his videos that much more compelling and enjoyable. Even the way that Neistat [unboxes things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw6bQZPhFrI) is entertaining, and if you watch his ["mail time" episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtOiRhapfFE), you'll see that he has a certain reckless and haphazard way of going through packages while talking to the camera. Neistat has turned his life into art. Even more impressively, when he's actively vlogging, Neistat creats a new and interesting piece of content every day. The vlogs aren't just him turning on a camera, talking to it, then uploading it to YouTube. He tells a story across an entire day, using footage from the studio, commutes, while travelling, and anything else to make it more interesting.

Neistat _seems_ like he has the fantasy life of an independent content creator. But of course, he works tirelessly to _make things_ every day, and as an entertainer, he's always on. But then he has to edit the vlog and upload it every night, with a work day that probably exceeds 16 hours!
