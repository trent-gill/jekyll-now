## Make stuff and do things

Lately, I've been watching a lot of [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtinbF-Q-fVthA0qrFQTgXQ), one of YouTube's best and most famous filmmakers. He's primarily known for inspirational  and adventurous videos, plus his near-daily vlog that has hundreds of episodes. His videos get millions of views, and for good reason. It's not just because they're entertaining and high quality (they are), but also because Neistat's _personality_ is irresistible. His vlogs showcase his life and personality better than anyone else I've followed. Neistat also uses cinematic techniques to make his videos that much more compelling and enjoyable. Even the way that Neistat [unboxes things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw6bQZPhFrI) is entertaining, and if you watch his ["mail time" episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtOiRhapfFE), you'll see that he has a certain reckless and haphazard way of going through packages while talking to the camera.

In a nutshell, Neistat has turned his life into art. Even more impressively, when he's actively vlogging, Neistat creates a new and interesting piece of content every day. The vlogs aren't just him turning on a camera, talking to it, then uploading it to YouTube. He tells a story across an entire day, using footage from the studio, commutes, while travelling, and anything else to make it more interesting.

Neistat _seems_ like he has the fantasy life of an independent content creator. But of course, he works tirelessly to _make things_ every day, and as an entertainer, he's always on. But then he has to edit the vlog and upload it every night, with a work day that probably exceeds 16 hours! He probably enjoys it (or at least presents it like he does), but it's easy to overlook that it took a ton of work to get where he is today.

The overarching message of Neistat's videos, if I dare make such a claim, is _do stuff_ and _make things_. Or, as he puts it in a [feature video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=jG7dSXcfVqE), "Do what you can't."

## "I would prefer not to."

Watching this much of Neistat's work has me thinking about my own "creative life" (or lack thereof). I've always thought of myself as independent, but I've never really done anything to support that thought, and it's probably true that I like the _idea_ of an independent career more than the reality. But if I think about it more simply -- _doing stuff_ and _making things_ -- I realize that my effort is sorely lacking. I don't really write, make podcasts, shoot videos, play music, build websites, or _do anything_ that I would count as creative.

I reflect on this a lot, and I can't help but wonder _why_? I used to write creatively, but it was a hobby that wasn't fun anymore, so I stopped. Playing around with websites and blogging is something I've enjoyed, but it gets to a point where I feel like I don't have anything interesting to say, so why bother?

It's easy to make excuses, but ultimately I'm like Bartleby, the Scrivener, who, when asked to help proofread a document, answers, "I would prefer not to."

## A compendium of excuses

I thought it would be fun to go through a list of creative things that I could be doing but don't because I've convinced myself that I'm not __________ enough to do it.

**Acting and Performing Arts:** Not talented enough, have a bad memory, and it's too hard. Also, stage fright.

**Writing:** Everything I write is boring and terrible, plus it's too hard.

**Podcasting:** Speaking in public? I'd rather not. Next.

**Music:** No talent.

**Filmmaking or YouTube:** A lot of work to create boring content that no one would watch.

**Art or Design:** I can't draw and I have no taste.

**Photography:** Not interested.

## The problem

So, what's the problem? A general disinterest and lack of imagination, plus an aversion to things that are hard and take a lot of work, are at the root of the problem. How about anxiety about failure, too? Trust me: these are not things I'm proud of. I probably sound glib and dismissive as I catalogue the reasons I'm complacent about my own working life and dearth of creativity in my free time.
