September, 2010.  It's 3 weeks until the Chicago Marathon, and Sammy Wanjiru has contracted a stomach virus.

For elite marathoners who must peak at the right time for one monumental effort, this by itself is cause for concern. But for Sammy Wanjiru, it's yet another interference in a 2010 campaign plagued by problems beyond physical fitness.

In 2008, Wanjiru announced himself in the road marathoning scene with a shocking Olympic Record at the Beijing Olympics, with a blistering pace from the gun in temperatures not conducive to fast marathoning. It would result in an Olympic Gold at only 21 years old, the youngest Gold medalist in the Marathon since 1932. It's widely considered one of the greatest marathon performances in history.

But Sammy was just getting started.

2009 was another astounding year for Wanjiru, with wins at the London Marathon and the Chicago Marathon putting him to the top of the World Marathon Major rankings. He was still only 23 years old in an event dominated by men several years his senior.

In 2010, Wanjiru's fame and wealth started catching up with him, and he was plagued by injuries. In April, a lingering knee problem caused him to drop out of the London Marathon. But his training was undermined by more than just the niggles that accompany marathon training. In truth, Wanjiru's training had suffered because of his ascendant wealth and fame, with him being distracted by late nights, an active social life, and a lifestyle less than ideal for a world-class marathoner.

The stomach virus was just another pitfall in a buildup plagued by them. Wanjiru and his coach and manager, Federico Rosa, adjusted their expectations for the Chicago Marathon. A top 3 seemed more within reach given Wanjiru's current form. Federico Rosa was one of the few people aware of Sammy's lifestyle problems contributing to his lack of fitness. It was debatable whether he would even start the Chicago Marathon.

October 10,2010.

Three weeks later, Wanjiru was on the starting line for the Chicago Marathon. Since Beijing, Wanjiru had the reputation of pushing the pace from the gun, but given the circumstances, the plan was to stay with the lead pack and _not_ push the pace from the gun.

“the greatest surprise in a race I’ve ever seen in my life,” said Federico Rosa, his manager.
