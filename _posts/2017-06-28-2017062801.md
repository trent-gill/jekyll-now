I've figured out an interesting way to update this blog from my desktop. Previously, I would drag markdown files into my GitHub repo in the browser *or* use GitHub Desktop to push local changes to the remote. Using Atom text editor, though, I can now write, commit, and push markdown files *directly* to my remote site from the text editor! It's truly remarkable. I don't know how to work from the command line but it's exciting that I can manage a site this way. I love the simplicity of plain text files written in markdown. And now, I can work right in the text editor to write new posts and make changes to old posts. Even better, the content stays consistent between my local computer, the GitHub repo, and this website. This stuff is fun.
