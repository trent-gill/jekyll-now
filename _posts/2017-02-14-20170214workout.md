A two hour run on Valentine's Day is an act of self-care, even when you crash and burn on the workout portion. 

Jack Daniels' 2Q marathon plan calls for difficult workouts from the start. Today was 10k easy followed by 2 x 4k at tempo pace. Normally that's a decent effort, but it's doable. After a long warmup at a moderate effort, though, the pace puts a lot of stress on your body. Happy to be done with it!
