If anyone is curious, I setup this Jekyll blog without touching the command line by using this repository:

* [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)

And in order to quickly publish microblogs from my iPhone and iPad, I'm using this Workflow:

* [Microblog Post to GitHub](https://workflow.is/workflows/8c16e3bedae8476abee62d3ad6a9fc25)

For longer entries, I expect that I'll still work from 1Writer and Working Copy, a powerful Git client for iOS. 

I wrote about [setting up that workflow](/Grav-GitHub-iPad-workflow) for a site built with Grav, but the system is basically the same.
