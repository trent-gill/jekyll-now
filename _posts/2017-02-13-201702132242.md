I just want to reiterate how many learning opportunities are available to anyone curious about the web. I'm not a developer or even close to it, yet with some patience, I've set up this Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub Pages thanks to the patient and helpful explanations of real developers. Now, with a bit of automation via Workflow, I can send a quick post to my site and have it live immediately without any unnecessary demands on me as a user. A little patience goes a long way.
