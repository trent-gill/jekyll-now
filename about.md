Hi! I'm Trent. I write the things that are on this blog. My interests are varied and disconnected, but generally I'm interested in how we make sense of our lives through narrative. On this blog, you'll find stuff about media, education, and tech, but you'll also find stuff about music, fiction, running, basketball, and video games. 

I don't want to bore you with my life story. Maybe one day. For now, I'll let you in on my only secrets: I work in and around education and I have too many hobbies. In a not-so-distant past, I wrote essays about literature toward an MA in English. I still haven't picked up my piece of paper. 

This site is the product of a learning experiment, or perhaps many. Since I got out of grad school and into the real world, I've been trying to complement my background in the humanities with basic knowledge of building websites. So, instead of just sticking with a packaged solution that works, I like dabbling in different content management systems and static websites. I've been through Tumblr, SquareSpace, WordPress, Grav, Ghost, and Jekyll for different projects. I'm not a developer, but I enjoy playing around on the open web, despite having no idea what I'm doing. 

I'm inspired by [the work of educators and technologists](http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/indie.html) who promote the [Indie and Open Web](https://indiewebcamp.com/). 

## Social

I'm mostly [on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/trent_g), but you can connect with me [a few other places](http://about.me/trentgill) too. 

## Work and Education

### Campus Manitoba

My day job is at [Campus Manitoba](http://campusmanitoba.ca/), a consortium of Manitoba's public universities and colleges. Our purpose is to implement and coordinate programs that encourage collaboration among Manitoba's post-secondary institutions for the benefit of all students.

I have a few responsibilities on different projects. For over two years I've helped students through our Virtual Help Desk, a service we use to ensure that all visitors to Campus Manitoba websites get the assistance they need. The main sources of traffic are [eCourses Manitoba](http://ecampusmanitoba.com) and [Set Your Course](http://www.setyourcourse.ca/). When I'm not helping students, I write web content and maintain social media.  

Since 2015, I've also helped coordinate projects under [OpenEd Manitoba](http://openedmb.ca), including the creation of a website for openly licensed educational resources and a call for open textbook reviews from Manitoba faculty. We work with our partners to organize presentations to inform faculty about open educational resources. 

### Brandon University

I was also a sessional instructor at [Brandon University](http://www.brandonu.ca), where I taught University Writing for two years. This foundational course introduced students to the principles of academic inquiry and thesis-based writing.

### Western University

I am a Master of Arts graduate from the Department of English and Writing Studies at the [University of Western Ontario](http://www.uwo.ca/english/). I finished an Independent Research Project toward the degree in 2012. The essay examines the thematic and formal influence of superhero comics on _The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay_ by Michael Chabon in the broader context of American literature after postmodernism. I still haven't picked up my piece of paper, but the effects of that degree linger on this blog.
